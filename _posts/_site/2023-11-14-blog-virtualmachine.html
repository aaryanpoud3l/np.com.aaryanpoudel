<p>Virtual Machine is an OS running over a base OS allowing users to run different operating systems on a single instance</p>

<p>Hypervisors are the VM monitors used for making virtualization possible.
It’s of two types of hypervisors:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type 1 Hypervisor</li>
  <li>Type 2 Hypervisor</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>In linux it’s recommended to use QEMU KVM as it’s Type 1.</li>
  <li>Type 1 is also called bare-metal as it runs directly on the host’s hardware. eg: QEMU KVM, Microsoft Hyper-V</li>
  <li>Type 2 is also called hosted as it runs on top of the host OS. eg: VMware, Virutal Box, Parallels Desktop</li>
</ul>
